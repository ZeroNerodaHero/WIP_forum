	        I don't like to write rules bc I believe people are often times well behaved, but I do believe that given I do not have the support of a battalion of CIA agents to moderate my website, I have to add some rules in.<br>

		    <ol>
		    <li>NO NSFW. Please don't post that here. </li>
		    <li>Don't use too sensitive language. At least be descriptive. SMH </li>
		    <li>Uhhhh don't be a glowie????? Sorry.  </li>
		    </ol>

		            /meta/ is for talking about the site and other sites <br>
			    /b/ is for anything within the rules. not that b <br>
			    /funcel/ is for talking about funcels <br>
			    /schizo/ is for talking about paranormal and occult shit.  <br>

			    ALL RULES APPLY TO THESE BOARDS. I WILL DELETE AND YEET.  <br>

		            This is an text-board. It is like an image-board except I don't want to fuck around with file hosting. I know it is quite possible to run it with sub 25gbs but I can't be bothered. <br> If you want to host imgs go make a discord server and post imgs there and then link it here with the correct syntax.

		        </div>
		        <div class=pcontent>
		            So you want to post the imgs? <br> The current way to post imgs,links, and videos(on youtube only) is: [tag](link){option} <br> <i>Example: [link](https://google.com){...}<br></i> Always have https or http bc if you don't things get wacky.
				

		            <ol>
		            <li>tag represents the type. The current three are IMG,LNK,YTB.</li>
			    <li>link is the link. It should always have http something bc if u don't ur gonna go into my server's error.</li>
                            <li>option has not been implemented yet. I don't really know what will happen if you do. Maybe nothing will appear to maybe a nuke will go off. I dunno just don't try. (EDIT: It just shows up as link{} no blowing up world. Sad :( )</li>

		            I've made a few secret boards go figure. But I'll list the ones that should be known: <br>
			-degen for degeneracy <br>
		        -test for testing out links and way to kill the site. but plz don't kill the site. <br>
		        If you do find the other one plz don't tell anyone bc it will ruin the dynamic.
