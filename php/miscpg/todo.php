                Hello, I'm just here to list out some of the features that I want to implement into this website and some that are currently done.

                <br>
                Things that are done:
                <ul>
                    <li>None :^(</li>
                </ul>

                <br>
                Things that are being worked on:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Image expansion. When I was on reading through the news, I realized that the images were either to small or too big. I'm going to default them down to thumbnails and use javascript to increase the size. So plz don't disable javascript.</li>
                    <li>
                        How to use site and rules. I haven't wrote anything about it. It is also going to be an easy thing to add on to "Things that are done"
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Advertisement. I'm not going to add like shitty ads that are annoying. I want to use the small ad space that I made to share random content that u guys want. If u want to advertise anything just DM on discord: lostCause#7797. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Some archive system I guess. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Text editor that allows links to pictures. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <footer>
