BASICALLY ALL THE ERRORS

1. TIME STAMP DOESN'T WORK LIKE IT IS SUPPOSE TO
    in post success, u need to add 
    CURRENT_TIMESTAMP 
    but not in my list
    
    reasons:
    got no fucking clue

    solution:
    no longer made timestamp default

2. BANNED WORDS
    I can bann words
    Needs:
    -a table for all the words
    -a php file to list and add words
    
    reason:
    bad ppl

    solution:
    add it

3. WHEN ADDING LINKS/IMGS, IF THERE IS NO SPACE THEN WORD IS DELETED

4. IPv6 sucks
    Whenever ipv4 fails, it will try ipv6. However, one of the problems is that there needs a way to hash or change that into a long int. php doesn't provide a function so will have to write one later. Currently all broken ips just get an ip of 0 or Null.


5. The buttons for up down terrible for not very wide screens. Phones mas o menos.

6. IP is not very good at tracking
	Use a cookie system instead. Users can delete cookies but make a post system where more post = less cooldown time. Doesn't store any ip or user info at all.
	COOKIE_STR - Total points - cooldown time - login/password
	if cookie doesn't exist bc user edited cookie renew cookie. always make sure the cookie exists inthe system.
	getUsrIp -> getUsrId
