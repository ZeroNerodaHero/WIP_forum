BASICALLY ALL THE ERRORS

1. TIME STAMP DOESN'T WORK LIKE IT IS SUPPOSE TO
    in post success, u need to add 
    CURRENT_TIMESTAMP 
    but not in my list
    
    reasons:
    got no fucking clue

    solution:
    no longer made timestamp default

2. BANNED WORDS
    I can bann words
    Needs:
    -a table for all the words
    -a php file to list and add words
    
    reason:
    bad ppl

    solution:
    add it

3. WHEN ADDING LINKS/IMGS, IF THERE IS NO SPACE THEN WORD IS DELETED

4. IPv6 sucks
    Whenever ipv4 fails, it will try ipv6. However, one of the problems is that there needs a way to hash or change that into a long int. php doesn't provide a function so will have to write one later. Currently all broken ips just get an ip of 0 or Null.
